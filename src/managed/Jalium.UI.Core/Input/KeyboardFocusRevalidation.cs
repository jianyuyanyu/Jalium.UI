/// there is not cosmetic: key events keep routing into the dead subtree, Tab cycles through

/// The check runs deferred on the dispatcher (<see cref="DispatcherPriority.Input"/>) rather than
/// inline, because a subtree is routinely detached and re-attached within one dispatcher batch
/// (Popup content moving between the overlay and its own window, recycling panels) and moving
/// focus in the middle of that would be wrong. Detach hops are recorded so the deferred pass can
/// still walk past the detach point and hand focus to the nearest still-connected focusable
/// ancestor — the element the user would expect to keep the keyboard cursor — clearing it when
