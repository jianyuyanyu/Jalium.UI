/// <see cref="Upload"/> failure means the pixels are perfectly good and the DEVICE refused them —
/// VRAM pressure, a device-removed frame, a texture dimension over the adapter's limit on a
/// WARP/RDP adapter — and the only thing that ever clears one is RETRYING the upload on the next
/// frame.</para>
