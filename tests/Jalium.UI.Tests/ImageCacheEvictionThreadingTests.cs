/// dedicated render thread exclusively owns the drawing context and is inside
/// <c>GetNativeBitmap</c> (dictionary lookup, in-place entry mutation, indexer insert, a
/// non-atomic byte accumulation and an enumerating trim loop) at exactly the moment a publish
/// lands. Handling the event inline therefore put a second writer on a plain
/// <c>Dictionary</c> and disposed a native texture the render thread was about to sample — the
/// "native brush use-after-free + Dictionary corruption" pair the render-thread ownership rule in
/// <c>Window.RenderFrame</c> exists to prevent — and both failure legs are swallowed (the decode
/// notifier catches per item, the render loop discards the frame), so it surfaced as an image that
/// is wrong on some machines with nothing in the log.</para>
/// <para>Nothing in the suite could see that: <c>grep -rn RasterChanged tests/</c> returned
/// nothing, and a headless host never starts a render thread, so the whole green suite had zero
/// discriminating power here. These two tests supply it — the first deterministically (the
/// eviction must NOT have been applied when the raiser returns, and must still be applied by the
/// owning thread's next frame), the second by running the real interleaving.</para>
